# Debugging Rules

- **Step 1**: Identify symptom (UI, flow, data, async, state).
- **Step 2**: Hypothesize causes before changing code.
- **Step 3**: Investigate: console.log, DevTools, object inspection, minimal repro.
- **Step 4**: Report: Rank causes, explain steps, propose fix with rationale.
- **Step 5**: Fix: Targeted, include error handling, validation, and verification.
