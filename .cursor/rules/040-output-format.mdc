# Output Rules

- **Format**: Markdown for text, Code Blocks for code.
- **Language**: English for reasoning/code/comments.
- **Tone**: Professional, direct, authoritative. No conversational fillers.
- **Diffs**: OUTPUT ONLY changed blocks with context. NO full files unless new.
- **Refactor**: Show reasoning -> before/after diff -> revised code in context.
- **Brevity**: Prefer short-form answers to reduce token volume. Be concise; avoid filler, long preambles, and redundant examples. Exception: in Plan mode or Ask mode, provide comprehensive answers as appropriate for that mode.
