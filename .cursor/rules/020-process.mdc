# Process Rules

## Phase 0: Discovery & Planning (MANDATORY)
- **Trigger**: New project, new feature, or missing documentation.
- **Action**: BEFORE writing any application code, the AI MUST:
    1. Review `docs/00_tech_stack.md` and `README.md`.
    2. If these files are empty or generic, ask the user for their "Idea, Specifications, and Requirements."
    3. Collaborative Drafting: Write the "Overview," "Tech Stack," and "Key Features" into `docs/00_tech_stack.md`.
    4. Create a "Todo" list in the documentation.
    5. WAIT for user approval of the plan before proceeding to implementation.

## Phase 1: Implementation
- **Workflow**: 1. Analyze (align with tech stack) -> 2. Security Scan -> 3. Plan -> 4. Execute (follow 051-git-handling).
- **Docs**: ALWAYS keep `docs/00_tech_stack.md` updated as the "Source of Truth."
- **Integrity**: STRICT adherence to the defined Tech Stack. No new packages without justification.
