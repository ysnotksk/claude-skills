# Git Policy

## Commit Message Convention
- **Style**: Strictly follow **Conventional Commits**.
  - Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

## Rules for Important Features
- **Trigger**: When implementing a "Major Feature" or "Complex Logic".
- **Requirement**: The commit message Body MUST include:
    1. **Context**: What was the problem or missing feature?
    2. **Solution**: Technical approach taken.
    3. **Impact**: What user-facing changes occurred?
- **Granularity**: Prefer atomic commits. Do not squash unrelated features into one "important" commit unless they are part of a single logical unit of work.

## Example
```text
feat(auth): add user authentication via magic links

- Context: Users needed a passwordless login method.
- Implemented `AuthService` to handle magic link generation with JWT.
- Added new API endpoint `/api/auth/magic-login`.
- Security: Tokens expire after 15 minutes to enhance security.
```
