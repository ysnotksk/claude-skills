# Git Policy

## Commit Convention
- Strictly follow **Conventional Commits**: `<type>[scope]: <description>`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

## Major Features
Commit body MUST include:
1. **Context**: What was the problem or missing feature?
2. **Solution**: Technical approach taken.
3. **Impact**: What user-facing changes occurred?

## Workflow
- **Commit before refactoring**: Always commit working tree before large refactors.
- **Branch when large**: Multi-file or high-impact changes go on a feature branch.
- **Test before merge**: Run test suite and fix failures before merging to default branch.
- **Push after merge**: Push updated branch so remote reflects the merge.
- **Atomic commits**: Do not squash unrelated changes.
